### Hi thereüñêÔ∏è

   I am Junior Front End Software Engineer. I consider myself an enthusiast of Technology who is working hard in order to take my hard and soft skills to the next level.
   I have just 9 months experience as a React JS Front End developer but with a huge desire to make things happen. It's been  a challenging experience but when we realize it and see our personal growth not only as an human being but also as Software Engenieer we figure out for ourselves that all the long hours invested worth the effort.  For many times It's been challenging but at the same time a really gratifing experience. 
   Most people don't know where to start when learning a subject matter like this, that's why Programming skills should be affordable and open to all people from all walks of life and backgrounds!
Education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time. 
   If you have a purpose in life keep moving on and  never give up!
